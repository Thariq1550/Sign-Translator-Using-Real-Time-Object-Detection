# Sign-Translator-Using-Real-Time-Object-Detection
Real time sign translator using tensorflow and openCV

The goal of this project was to design an AI system that can detect that the sign language of the user and show the output

•	The images are collected for deep learning using the webcam and OpenCV, images for detection are labelled using labelImg. Tensorflow Object pipeline configuration is setup and transfer learning is used to train a deep learning model.

•	The sign language is detected in real time using OpenCV.

•	This system translates the sign language into text. The accuracy of the model is around 98.72%. The accuracy of the model was less with poor lighting. As future enhancements, more dynamic video signs can be trained to improve the accuracy.
